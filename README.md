GPT-2, developed by OpenAI, is a large-scale transformer-based language model designed to generate human-like text. Currently, the advancements in auto-regressive language models such as the GPT-2 is based on the Generative Pre-trained Transformer architecture and has significantly improved its capabilities in text generation tasks. The GPT-2 model excels in predicting the next word in a sequence, and has found widespread applications across various domains. It has been widely used in various natural language processing tasks, demonstrating impressive capabilities in generating coherent and contextually relevant text. GPT-2 demonstrates a strong ability to produce grammatically correct text. GPT-2 generated sentences adhere to standard grammatical rules, with minimal errors. GPT-2 excels in maintaining coherence between the inserted text and its surrounding context. The transitions between prefixes, inserted text, and suffixes are smooth and logical. The model ensures that the inserted text is relevant and seamlessly integrated with the given context, enhancing the overall readability and coherence of the generated text.

GPT-2 demonstrates remarkable proficiency in generating fluent, grammatically correct, and coherent text. Its ability to produce natural-sounding sentences that adhere to standard grammatical rules and maintain logical consistency with the surrounding context makes it a powerful tool for various natural language processing tasks. While occasional minor errors may occur, GPT-2's overall performance in these areas is highly impressive and indicative of its advanced capabilities as a language model. We can significantly improve the capabilities of decoder-only models like GPT-2 for tasks requiring text insertion and rewriting, thereby broadening their applicability and enhancing their utility in real-world applications.
